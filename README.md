# Literary Trivia: It's Lit! 

Lit Trivia is a ten-question self-scoring trivia game that tests user's knowledge of literary, publishing, and bookselling history. 

# Brief example 

Rendered in the browser, Lit Trivia looks like this: 
![Lit Trivia]('./images/images/littrivia_screenshot.png')

# List of features

This project is pretty close to its original rendering: a ten-question, self-scoring game with clean, simple design; photos for options; and links to enable users to tap into a greater literary community. 

This project was built using a simple HTML wireframe, the JavaScript Dom, and CSS Styling. Areas for improvement include manipulating the dom so that each image-options "alt" text fills in with the title; fixing the nav bar so that it spans the top of the browser window; fixing the home button so that it restarts the game. 

This developer would like future iterations of this game to include different categories of literary trivia (i.e. "Science Fiction," "Bestsellers," etc.)
